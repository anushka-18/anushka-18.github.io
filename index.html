        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer who takes full ownership of hard problems — from architecture
            decisions to production rollout. I love building <span class="highlight">products that users actually interact with</span>.
            For the past 5+ years, I've been working in fintech - first at Airtel Payments Bank building mobile banking
            features for millions of users in India, and now at Goldman Sachs working on trading platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            What gets me excited? Taking a complex problem, figuring out the right solution, and shipping something
            that makes a real difference in people's lives. Whether it's a payment flow that just works, or a feature
            that saves traders hours of manual work - I care about the impact, not just the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I studied at <strong>University of Washington</strong> (MS) and <strong>Delhi Technological University</strong> (BTech),
            and I've been lucky to work with some incredibly smart people who've pushed me to grow.

            fast and reliable. But more than any specific technology, I care about working on products
            where I can see the direct impact of what I build.
