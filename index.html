        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer who loves building <span class="highlight">products that users actually interact with</span>.
            For the past 5+ years, I've been working in fintech - first at Airtel Payments Bank building mobile banking
            features for millions of users in India, and now at Goldman Sachs working on trading platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            What gets me excited? Taking a complex problem, figuring out the right solution, and shipping something
            that makes a real difference in people's lives. Whether it's a payment flow that just works, or a feature
            that saves traders hours of manual work - I care about the impact, not just the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I studied at <strong>University of Washington</strong> (MS) and <strong>Delhi Technological University</strong> (BTech),
            and I've been lucky to work with some incredibly smart people who've pushed me to grow.

                Building trading platform features in the Consumer & Wealth Management division.
                I've worked on everything from designing storage architecture that cut costs by 35%,
                to optimizing APIs that traders rely on every day, to building compliance systems
                that detect market manipulation. Also had the chance to mentor interns and help
                ship features they built.

                This is where I fell in love with building products at scale. Fintech in India was
                an emerging market, and I got to be part of that story - building backend services
                that onboarded ~10,000 new users every day. Worked on payment flows, customer journey
                analytics, and high-performance APIs. There's something special about building products
                that help people access services for the first time.

        <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
        <p>
            Technically, I enjoy working with Java, Spring Boot, AWS, and building systems that need to be
            fast and reliable. But more than any specific technology, I care about working on products
            where I can see the direct impact of what I build.
